## OSF

- the OSF project is publicly available
- the folder structure is very clear (data and analysis are separated)
- the OSF project did not have any explanation in the Wiki

# Analysis

- the JASP output could be added, together with the already present pdf
- they share xlsx and csv... to avoid redundancy and confusion, better keep only csv
- **R Script PDR1.R**
    - the code does not point to the data
        - solutions: add correct absolute path, use package `here`, or Rprojects
