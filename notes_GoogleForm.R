How could the documentation be improved? *

  There could be a readme file included as well as a wiki page on the OSF project. Additionally, there could be more comments on the code itself and more documentation on the correspondence between analyses and reported results. We were a little confused about which data should be excluded for which analyses.


What did you like about the documentation? *

  There was a codebook, which is really important! The comments were clear and easy to understand, with the exception of data exclusion. It was also really nice to see the preregistered and exploratory analyses in separate sections in the paper. Although this is not strictly documentation, the folder structure is very clear and makes useful distinctions.


Any suggestions on how the analysis could be more transparent?

  We think that most of the improvements relate to documentation (discussed above). Additionally, code could be more readable, e.g. following styler (R package with addin). We also noticed that a couple of potentially useful scripts were not shared. Those are: 1) the script used to tidy up the raw data to create the final data file; 2) the script (or macros, list of  commands) used to run the Bayesian analysis.


Any suggestions on how project could be more reusable?
  
  Adding a license would be a big help. Perhaps it would also be useful to use R projects. We think that this project would be very reusable with reproducibility in mind. Perhaps it wouldn't be reusable for different projects, but that's not a problem.

Any final comments?

  Thank you for sharing your work :) Other than a small problem with the path when loading the data, all the other code run without errors! However, we did have trouble reproducing the results (the actual numbers) from the first preregistered analysis.
